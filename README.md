# Ticket Sales Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing raw ticket sales data from multiple sources. The data had inconsistent city names, missing values, formatting errors, and fragmented tables. Using Excel, I consolidated, cleaned, and standardized the dataset to prepare it for further analysis.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Project Type
- Data Cleaning & Standardization

## Objective
- Combine fragmented data tables
- Standardize inconsistent city names
- Clean ticket price formatting and handle missing values
- Document unresolved issues for stakeholder input

## Data Cleaning Summary

| Issue                         | Resolution                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Fragmented data tables         | Used `VSTACK` to vertically combine          |
| Extra spaces in names          | Applied `TRIM` function                       |
| Inconsistent city spellings    | Used mapping table with `XLOOKUP`             |
| Missing values in city and price | Left for stakeholder review                  |

## Next Steps
- Collaborate with stakeholders to clarify missing data
- Normalize currency values or convert to a standard currency
- Implement automated data validation rules
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization
